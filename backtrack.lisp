; implementation of backtrack from George Luger's Artificial Intelligence 6ed p 97
; sl state list ie states in current path being tried
; nsl new state list ie unvisited nodes awaiting evaluation
; de dead ends ie states whose descendants failed to contain a goal
; cs current state
; is-goal predicate takes a state and returns nil if not a goal
